1.1 Propositions and logical operations
Logic is the study of formal reasoning. Logic is useful in any field in which it is important to make precise statements. 
The most basic element in logic is a proposition. A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.

There are an infinite number of prime numbers.	True
The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1812.	False

A proposition's truth value is a value indicating whether the proposition is actually true or false. 
A proposition is still a proposition whether its truth value is known to be true, known to be false, unknown, or a matter of opinion. 

Proposition         	Comment
Two plus two is four.	Truth value is true.
Two plus two is five.	Truth value is false.
Monday will be cloudy.	Truth value is unknown.
The movie was funny.	Truth value is a matter of opinion.
The extinction of the dinosaurs was caused by a meteor.	Truth value is unknown.

A compound proposition is created by connecting individual propositions with logical operations.
A logical operation combines propositions using a particular composition rule.

For example, the conjunction operation is denoted by ∧. 
The proposition p ∧ q is read "p and q" and is called the conjunction of p and q. 
p ∧ q is true if both p is true and q is true. p ∧ q is false if p is false, q is false, or both are false.

p ∧ q is true only when both p and q are true.
p ∧ q is false for all other combinations.

The disjunction operation is denoted by ∨. 
The proposition p ∨ q is read "p or q", and is called the disjunction of p and q. 
p ∨ q is true if either one of p or q is true, or if both are true. 
p ∨ q is true when either of p or q is true.
p ∨ q is false only when p and q are both false.

The exclusive or of p and q evaluates to true when p is true and q is false or when q is true and p is false. 
The exclusive or operation is usually denoted with the symbol ⊕. 
The proposition p ⊕ q is true if exactly one of the propositions p and q is true but not both.
p ⊕ q does not evaluate to true if p is true and q is true.
p ⊕ q is true if exactly one of p and q are true. In the second row of the table, p is true and q is not true.
p ⊕ q does not evaluate to true if p is false and q is false.

The inclusive or operation is the same as the disjunction (∨) operation and evaluates to true when one or both of the propositions are true.

The negation operation acts on just one proposition and has the effect of reversing the truth value of the proposition. 
The negation of proposition p is denoted ¬p and is read as "not p". 

The truth value of ¬p is the opposite of the truth value of p.

¬ (not)
∧ (and)
∨ (or)
