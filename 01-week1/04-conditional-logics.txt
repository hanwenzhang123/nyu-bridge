1.3 Conditional statements
The conditional operation is denoted with the symbol →. 
The proposition p → q is read "if p then q". 
The proposition p → q is false if p is true and q is false; otherwise, p → q is true.

A compound proposition that uses a conditional operation is called a conditional proposition. 
A conditional proposition expressed in English is sometimes referred to as a conditional statement, as in "If there is a traffic jam today, then I will be late for work."

In p → q, the proposition p is called the hypothesis, and the proposition q is called the conclusion.

The converse, contrapositive, and inverse
Three conditional statements related to proposition p → q are so common that they have special names. The converse of p → q is q → p. 
The contrapositive of p → q is ¬q → ¬p.The inverse of p → q is ¬p → ¬q.

Table 1.3.3: The converse, contrapositive, and inverse.
Proposition:	  p → q	    Ex: If it is raining today, the game will be cancelled.
Converse:	  q → p	    If the game is cancelled, it is raining today.
Contrapositive:	  ¬q → ¬p	    If the game is not cancelled, then it is not raining today.
Inverse:	  ¬p → ¬q	    If it is not raining today, the game will not be cancelled.



The biconditional operation
If p and q are propositions, the proposition "p if and only if q" is expressed with the biconditional operation and is denoted p ↔ q. 
The proposition p ↔ q is true when p and q have the same truth value and is false when p and q have different truth values.

Alternative ways of expressing p ↔ q in English include "p is necessary and sufficient for q" or "if p then q, and conversely". 
The term iff is an abbreviation of the expression "if and only if", as in "p iff q". The truth table for p ↔ q is given below:
