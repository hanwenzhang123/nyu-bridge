In computer science we design algorithms to solve computational problems.
we then implement them in a formal pprograming language which would be executed by the computer


computation problems
when stating a computational problem:
1. define set of legal inputs
2. dedine the required output, for each input

example: the sorting problem
input: a sequence of numbers <a1, a2, .... an>
output: a reording <b1, b2, .... bn> of the input sequence such that b1<= b2<= ... <=bn

algorithm
a well defined computational procedure, that describes how to transform a given input to its desired output. 

Input - well designed set of instruction - output

sorting algorithms
- selection sort
- insertion sort
- bubbe sort
- merge sort
.... (more)

selection sort (easiest way)
for (curr = 0; curr<=n-2; curr+=1)
  min = curr
  for(j = curr+1; j<= n-1; j+=1)
    if(A[j]<A[min])
      min=j
  swap(A[curr], A[min])
