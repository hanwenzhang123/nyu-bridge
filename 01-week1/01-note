In computer science we design algorithms to solve computational problems.
we then implement them in a formal pprograming language which would be executed by the computer


computation problems
when stating a computational problem:
1. define set of legal inputs
2. dedine the required output, for each input

example: the sorting problem
input: a sequence of numbers <a1, a2, .... an>
output: a reording <b1, b2, .... bn> of the input sequence such that b1<= b2<= ... <=bn

algorithm
a werll defined computational procedure, that describes how to transform a given input to its desired output. 

Input - well designed set of instruction - output
