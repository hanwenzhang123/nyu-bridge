Definition
The computer is an electromechanical device which takes input, does processing and produces output.

Types of Computer

What is common Between Them?

Communication between the devices
- via a bus

The CPU

Machine-Language

Instruction set
- CPU can perform, a set of instruction as small asa 100
- when the CPU receives a particular instruction, it performs that task

Fetch-Execute Cycle
- fetch instruction
- decode instruction
- execute instruction

Memory

Hierarchy
top : register (built directly in the CPU)
Cache
RAM

RAM

Secondary Storage

HDD vs SSD

Networking
- networks are interconnected via the internet

Phsical Connections
Types of connections:
- copper
- fiber
- wireless
Protocols:
- how do we know when to start sending data?
- how do we know who its from?
- how do we know who its going to?
Types of physicaal connections
- ethernet (physical)
- wifi (802.11)
- ATM

Packets
- data is sent from a program to another indirectly by using multiple protocols
- generally there will be protocols for
  - application, logical network, physical network
- data is encapsulated into a packet then give to the application protocol, lower level;
  which then adds a header for the information for the receiver to understand what is being sent
- when the packet moves to the logical protoccol, it too adds a header on top of application layer's header.

Layers we commonly use
Application
- HTTP - Hyper Text Transport Protocol
- SMTP - Simple Mail Transport Protocol
- IMAP - Internet Mail Access Protocol
Logical (more formally called network)
- usually broken down into two layers
  - connection oriented vs connection less deals with the ordering and guarantee of delivery of packets
    - UDP (connection less)
    - TCP (connection oriented)
      Now watching video via HTTP over TCP
  - Global delivery of packets
    - Internet Protocol - IP
Physical
- often adds a header and footer (to indicate the end)
- mostly concerned with local addressing and how to deal with eccentricities of the physical medium
