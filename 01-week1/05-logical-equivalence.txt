1.4 Logical equivalence
Definition: the compound propositions p and q are said to be logically equivalent if p ↔ q is a tautology.
Logical equivalence is denoted by ↔ and ≡
  if p is true, q has to be true
    if p is false, q has to be false
A compound proposition is a tautology if the proposition is always true, regardless of the truth value of the individual propositions that occur in it. 
A compound proposition is a contradiction if the proposition is always false, regardless of the truth value of the individual propositions that occur in it.

Two compound propositions are said to be logically equivalent if they have the same truth value regardless of the truth values of their individual propositions. 
If s and r are two compound propositions, the notation s ≡ r is used to indicate that r and s are logically equivalent. 
For example, p and ¬¬p have the same truth value regardless of whether p is true or false, so p ≡ ¬¬p. 
Propositions s and r are logically equivalent if and only if the proposition s ↔ r is a tautology.



1.5 Laws of propositional logic
If two propositions are logically equivalent, then one can be substituted for the other within a more complex proposition. 
The compound proposition after the substitution is logically equivalent to the compound proposition before the substitution.
For example p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q. Therefore, (p ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ q)  ≡  (p ∨ r) ∧ (p → q)
